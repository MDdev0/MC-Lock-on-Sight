# MC-Lock-on-Sight
A Minecraft datapack that allows players to lock the position of other players by looking at them.

## How to download datapack

Download ZIP from the Green Code dropdown.<br/>
Drag the ZIP file to your datapacks folder <br/>
Unzip and extract the file. <br/>
Once ingame, type /reload <br/>


## How to setup in game:

To begin, pick a friend as the Survivor. <br/>
Use the following command on the designated survivor: `/tag <name> add can_sightlock`. <br/>
If you are adding multiple survivors *or* wish to make someone immune to being locked: `/tag <name> add sightlock_immune`. <br/>
Happy hunting! <br/>

## Gameplay:
Once everything is set up, things will work like this:

* Anyone (who isn't immune) in the Surivor's line of sight will be frozen in place. </br> **When that happens:**
  * A trail of particles will show the Survivor's line of sight.
  * The frozen player will start glowing.
